## RECURSIVE PUSH_SWAP
By chdonnat (Christophe Donnat from 42 Perpignan, France)

A fun and unconventional alternative for the push_swap project, implemented using three recursive functions.


This algorithm sorts 500 values in fewer than 5500 moves but takes around 1000 moves to sort 100 values. For a push_swap version that achieved a 125% score, check out my other repository:
